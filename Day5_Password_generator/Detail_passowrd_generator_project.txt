# Day 05 – Password Generator 🔐

This Python script generates secure, random passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols. It’s part of my 100 Days of Python Challenge and helps practice working with lists, loops, and the `random` module.

## 🛠️ Features
- Customizable password length
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- Uses `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()` for randomness
- Easy to modify for stronger or simpler passwords

---

## 📄 How It Works
1. The user specifies how many letters, numbers, and symbols they want.
2. The script randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3. It combines and shuffles them to create a secure password.
4. The final password is printed to the screen.
