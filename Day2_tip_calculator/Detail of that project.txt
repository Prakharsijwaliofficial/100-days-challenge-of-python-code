📅 Day 02 – Tip Calculator 💸
🧠 Project Overview
This Python script helps users calculate how much tip to leave at a restaurant and how to split the total bill among a group. It’s a great way to practice working with numbers, user input, and basic math operations.
🛠️ What It Does
- Asks the user for:
- Total bill amount
- Tip percentage they want to give
- Number of people splitting the bill
- Calculates:
- Total bill including tip
- Each person’s share
- Outputs the amount each person should pay, rounded to 2 decimal places.

📄 Code Example
print("Welcome to the Tip Calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? ₹"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

tip_amount = bill * (tip / 100)
total_bill = bill + tip_amount
split_amount = total_bill / people

final_amount = round(split_amount, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ₹{final_amount}")

🧪 Sample Output
Welcome to the Tip Calculator!
What was the total bill? ₹1200
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10
How many people to split the bill? 4
Each person should pay: ₹330.0
