📅 Day 04 – Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊✋✌️
🧠 Project Overview
This Python script simulates the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game between a human player and the computer. It uses ASCII art for visual flair and introduces randomness, user input, and conditional logic.

🛠️ What It Does
- Displays ASCII art for rock, paper, and scissors.
- Takes user input (rock, paper, or scissors).
- Randomly selects the computer’s choice.
- Compares both choices and declares the winner or a draw.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.

📄 Code Summary
import random

# ASCII art for each choice
rock = '''...'''
paper = '''...'''
scissors = '''...'''

# List of choices
list_of_choice = ["rock", "paper", "scissor"]

# Computer randomly picks one
computer_choice = random.choice(list_of_choice)

# User input
human_input = input("Enter your choice. rock, paper, scissors").lower()

# Game logic
if human_input == computer_choice:
    print("It's a draw")
elif human_input == "rock" and computer_choice == "paper":
    print("Computer wins")
elif human_input == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock":
    print("You win!!")
elif human_input == "paper" and computer_choice == "scissor":
    print("Computer wins")
elif human_input == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissor":
    print("You win!!")
elif human_input == "scissor" and computer_choice == "rock":
    print("Computer wins")
elif human_input == "scissor" and computer_choice == "paper":
    print("You win!!")
else:
    print("Please enter a valid choice")

Computer chose: scissors
You win!!
